# Meizu

- Verdict: **üçÖ Terrible!**

There's not a lot to say about Meizu... OEM unlock option seem to be missing, without that option, bootloader will check flag upon unlock cmd, but it refuse because flag were off. That's why OEM unlock option is only to make flag on, probably shell or adb cannot turn that on.<br/>
They've never had unlockable bootloaders, and although there are a number of unofficial methods. Some Snapdragon devices have a [FRP exploit you can use in EDL to unlock][fpr-exploit], If your device is unsupported by the FRP exploit and isn't supported by mtkclient, there are [paid services][paid-services] which you can use at your own risk.
